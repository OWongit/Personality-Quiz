# Personality-Quiz
 Implement a BuzzFeed-style "BrettFeed" quiz using a binary tree. Read quizzes from a text file, then prompt users for choices at each node until reaching a result leaf. Track the pathâ€™s total score, export quizzes, and add new questions by replacing result nodes with choice nodes, all via recursive methods.
