# Personality-Quiz
Implements a BuzzFeed-style "BrettFeed" quiz using a binary tree. Reads quizzes from a text file, then prompts users for choices at each node until reaching a result leaf. Tracks the pathâ€™s total score, exports quizzes, and adds new questions by replacing result nodes with choice nodes, all via recursive methods.
